# Nom Nom Skyscraper

*A balanced diet of concrete and veggies.*

**Nom Nom Skyscraper** is a game where you have to strategically place different wild plantlive or (industrial) buildings on a map.

Your task is to have at least 25 % of fields filled with both, industry and wilderness but you need to keep a good balance.

The placed cards on the map interact with each other. Each field has a "wilderness" and an "industry" value. Once the value is bigger than 4 it also starts spawning additional buildings or plants.
